1. Hardware Installation

2. Server 

I used Python API of raspberry's GPIO pins and the server is also implemented in Python by using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). In order to run server, first update the passphrase of your server in the code. Then run;

<code>python doorServer.py</code>

Before server start, you can see the <code>key</code> of your garage door in terminal.

By default server is running on <code>:8080</code> port of your raspberrypi.

You can open your garage door by using following address in browser;

<code>http://< IPofYourRaspberry >:8080/openDoor/< key ></code>

3. Network
